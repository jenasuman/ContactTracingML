# How Contact Tracing Works?
Once a person is positive for coronavirus, it is very important to identify other people who may have been infected by the patients diagnosed. To identify infected people, the authorities follow the activity of patients diagnosed in the last 14 days. This process is called contact tracking. Depending on the country and the local authority, the search for contacts is carried out either by manual methods or by numerical methods.

# Contact Tracing with Machine Learning
DBSCAN is a density-based data clustering algorithm that groups data points in a given space. The DBSCAN algorithm groups data points close to each other and marks outlier data points as noise. I will use the DBSCAN algorithm for the task of contact tracing with Machine Learning.
